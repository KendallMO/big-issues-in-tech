  <h1>5G</h1>
  <h5>5G is on its way, but it's not here yet, despite the false promises of companies like AT&T. With speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, 5G has the ability to change the world by enabling speed-of-thought communication. But 5G is also an enormous and expensive infrastructural undertaking and will require new regulatory frameworks. Devices will have to be replaced to take advantage of the new network, increasing the amount of electronic waste we produce. Rural areas that still have incredibly slow wifi will be further left in the dust as the digital divide deepens. And to top it off, it will require an enormous amount of energy to run, far more than we're able to produce through renewables. None of this will stop 5G from coming, but what should we be doing now to help prepare? </h5>
