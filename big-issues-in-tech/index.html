  <h1>5G</h1>
  <h5>5G is on its way, but it's not here yet, despite the false promises of companies like AT&T. With speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, 5G has the ability to change the world by enabling speed-of-thought communication. But 5G is also an enormous and expensive infrastructural undertaking and will require new regulatory frameworks. Devices will have to be replaced to take advantage of the new network, increasing the amount of electronic waste we produce. Rural areas that still have incredibly slow wifi will be further left in the dust as the digital divide deepens. And to top it off, it will require an enormous amount of energy to run, far more than we're able to produce through renewables. None of this will stop 5G from coming, but what should we be doing now to help prepare? </h5>

<h6> The chart showed the dose of radiation received by the brain as rising from left to right, with the increasing frequency of the wireless signal. The slope was gentle at first, but when the line reached the wireless frequencies associated with computer networking, it shot straight up, indicating a dangerous level of exposure.</h6>

<h6>studies tell us that RF radiation is harmful at even low and short exposures, and that it impacts children and fetuses more rapidly than adults. Among the findings are that RF radiation is carcinogenic, causes DNA damage, affects fertility and the endocrine system, and has neurological impacts. </h6>
